**IronPE** is a minimal Windows PE manual loader written in Rust for both x86 and x64 PE files.

This project is a **Rust reimplementation** of my previous project **[dotNetPELoader](https://github.com/iss4cf0ng/dotNetPELoader)**, which implemented a manual PE loader in C#.

The goal of IronPE is to explore how Windows loads Portable Executables internally and to demonstrate how this process can be implemented in Rust.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended for **educational and research purposes only**.

It is designed to help understand:

- Windows PE internals
- Manual loading techniques
- Reverse engineering concepts

## Features

- Manual PE loading
- Section mapping
- Base relocations
- Import resolution
- Execute PE from memory
- x86 and x64 PE support

## Background

This project was inspired by my previous implementation:

- [dotNetPELoader](https://github.com/iss4cf0ng/dotNetPELoader) (C#)

In that project, I implemented a PE loader using .NET and WinAPI.  
IronPE rewrites the same concept in **Rust**, which provides better memory safety while still allowing low-level Windows API access.

The purpose of this project is **educational**, to better understand:

- PE file structure
- Windows loader behavior
- Manual PE mapping techniques

## How It Works
IronPE performs the following steps to execute a PE file from memory:

1. Read PE file into memory
2. Parse PE headers
3. Allocate memory using `VirtualAlloc`
4. Copy PE headers and sections
5. Apply **base relocations**
6. Resolve **imports** using `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`
7. Transfer execution to the **Original Entry Point (OEP)**

This process mimics the behavior of the Windows PE loader.

An x64 PE cannot be loaded by an x86 loader, and vice versa.

## Build
Requirements:
- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)
- Windows

Build the project:
```
cd IronPE
build.bat
```

## Usage
```
IronPE.exe --coffee
IronPE.exe --x86 <x86_pe_file>
IronPE.exe --x64 <x64_pe_file>
```

Example:
```
IronPE.exe --x86 Win32\mimikatz.exe
IronPE.exe --x64 x64\mimikatz.exe
```
